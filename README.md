# Overview

This project is prepared for Pusula's Data Science case study. It aims to analyze a dataset related to
the side effects of medications. The dataset includes user information and the side effects of the
medications used by these users.

# DataSet

The dataset is provided in Excel format and later converted to CSV format. It contains user
information and numerical and categorical variables that provide information about medication side
effects (e.g., User_ID, Gender, Date_of_Birth, Nationality, City, Medication_Name, etc.).

# How to Run the Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook program.
2. Upload the CSV file to the opened page (you can use the Upload button in the top right corner or
the drag-and-drop method).
3. Next, upload the .ipynb file to the same page (again, use the Upload button or drag-and-drop).
4. Open the uploaded .ipynb file. When the file opens, you will see the code written in order on the
page. You should run these codes sequentially.
5. If you encounter any errors while running the code, make sure that you have imported the
necessary libraries.
